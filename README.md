# Laikata antenna aim system

As the antenna we built was guidable, we developed some simple code that aims towards the target.

It was made using Arduino IDE, because it is suitable for small projects like this one. Maybe on a far future it will be migrated to cross-compiled CGG, but that won't be done for now.
