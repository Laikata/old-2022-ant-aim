# Laikata antenna aim system

As the antenna we buildt was guidable, we developed some simple code that aims towards the target.

It is also capable of switching to "manual mode" if things go wrong, so you can use a joystick to move it.

It was made using Arduino IDE, because it is suitable for small projects like this one. Maybe on a far future it will be migrated to cross-compiled CGG, but that won't be done for now.
